![](thumbnail.png)

## Hosted Version of the Project:
[m5react-day-10-homework-universal-language-translator-webapp](https://m5react-day-10-homework-universal-language-translator-webapp.vercel.app/)

## Objective
+ The Universal Language Translator is an innovative and user-friendly web application designed to seamlessly translate text from one language to another. This project employs an API-based approach to provide accurate and efficient language translation services.
+ **Language Selection**: Users can choose both the source and target languages from a comprehensive list of supported languages. This flexibility allows the application to cater to a wide range of linguistic preferences.
+ **User Input**: A simple and intuitive user interface allows users to input the text they wish to translate. Whether it's a sentence, paragraph, or document, the Universal Language Translator can handle various lengths of text.
+ **Translation on Demand**: Upon entering the text, users can initiate the translation process with a single click on the 'Translate' button. The application will then communicate with the chosen API to convert the text from the source language to the selected target language.
+ **API Integration**: The project leverages a reliable and efficient language translation API to ensure the accuracy and quality of translations. The chosen API should support a wide array of languages and offer real-time translation capabilities.
